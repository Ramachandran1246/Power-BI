ðŸ“Š Loan Performance & Borrower Profile Analysis Dashboard

I recently worked on creating an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze loan performance and borrower behavior.

âœ… Key Highlights:

Total Funded Amount: $6.63bn

Fully Paid Loan Percentage: 39.62%

Average Interest Rate: 13.83% (higher for 60-month terms)

Loan Status Distribution shows 52% of loans are in grace/current

Borrower Profile Analysis reveals:

$73.29K average annual income

148K non-verified borrowers

Higher delinquency among renters vs homeowners

ðŸ“ˆ This dashboard helps in identifying risk patterns, borrower credibility, and repayment behavior â€“ which are critical for financial decision-making.

ðŸ”— Tools Used: Power BI, Data Modeling, DAX

Would love to hear feedback from the community on how this can be further improved or extended (e.g., predictive insights for churn/default risk). ðŸš€
